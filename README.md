# Overview

The Customer Spending Prediction web app aims to accurately predict customer spending based on various factors such as gender, age, purchase frequency, and income. By utilizing machine learning algorithms and a dataset containing customer information, this app can provide valuable insights for businesses to make data-driven decisions.
Files

The following files are included in this project:

    Google Colab Notebook: The notebook contains the code for data preprocessing, model training, and prediction. It provides detailed explanations and steps for each stage of the project.

    CSV file: This file contains the dataset used for training and testing the model. It includes customer information, such as gender, age, purchase frequency, income, and corresponding spending data.

# Usage

To use this Customer Spending Prediction app, follow these steps:

    Access the Google Colab notebook provided in the project files.

    Run the notebook cells sequentially to preprocess the data, train the model, and perform predictions.

    Ensure that the dataset file is available in the specified directory or update the file path accordingly in the notebook.

    Input the customer's data, including gender, age, purchase frequency, and income.

    The app will utilize the trained model to predict the customer's spending based on the provided information.

Please note that the accuracy of the predictions may vary based on the quality and representativeness of the dataset used for training and testing. Additionally, it is recommended to adapt and customize the code according to specific business requirements and datasets.
